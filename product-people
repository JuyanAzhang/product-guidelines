Product Person Guidelines

Guidelines for the people looking to build successful, truly amazing products. 


1. If it requires any explanation, you've got work to do.

2. Tool tips should be a luxury. 

13. Pay closest attention to disconfirming evidence and disconfirming feedback.

3. Opt-out actions are *significantly* more effective than opt-in actions. 

18. Design your product based on what users are most likely to do, not what they should do (these are usually very different).

8. The best products make users feel *powerful*.

9. You should prioritize features based on how powerful they make users feel. 

12. Building great products requires an inordinate amount of focus: saying no to 99/100 great ideas.

14. Only build features that are rooted in real utility. If the feature was built to add fun it will be used occasionally, if ever. 

15. People should be able to pattern match your new, innovative system to some abstraction they are already familiar with. 

17. Removing friction between users and your value offering is your goal. Reduce clicks, reduce cognitive overhead, reduce effort.

14. Wherever you can, look to increase the versatility of your tool.

15. If you have to keep building features to make your product interesting to people, you should probably pivot. 

16. Focus on making your product as useful as possible in one-player mode (when no one else is on the platform). 

17. Investing in delight can pay massive dividends, particularly in areas that users visit often. 

7. Whenever you remove significant friction from an established behavior, consider adding constraints.

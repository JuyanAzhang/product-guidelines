Guidelines for product people.


1. If it requires an explanation, you've got work to do.

2. Tool tips should be a luxury, not a necessity. 

3. Pay closest attention to disconfirming evidence.

4. Opt-out functionality is powerful, but dangerous. Use it sparingly. Opt-in is preferred b/c it affords users more control.

5. Design your product based on what users are most likely to do, not what they should do (these are usually very different).

6. The best products make users feel *powerful*.

7. More than anything, users want control. Control over the interface, control over their life, control over their time. 

8. Building great products requires an inordinate amount of focus: saying no to 99/100 great ideas.

9. Only build features that are rooted in real utility. Fun is an emergent property, not something you should build for directly. 

10. People should be able to pattern match your new, innovative system to some abstraction they are already familiar with. 

11. Remove friction between users and your value offering. Reduce clicks, reduce cognitive overhead, reduce effort, reduce time.

12. If you have to keep building features to make your product interesting to people, you should probably pivot. 

13. Investing in delight can pay dividends, particularly in areas that users visit often. 

14. Focus maniacally on intuitiveness. Don't even think about anything else until it is. 

15. Run lots of experiments. The closer you can get to the real thing, the better - MVPs, functional prototypes, etc. Easier to falsify your assumptions.

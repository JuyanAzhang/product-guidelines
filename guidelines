First, three timeless aphorisms that are the pillars behind everything on this list:

Only simple products last. 

Convenience always wins.

Don't make me think.


Of course, these are guidelines. They aren't the answer 100% of the time. But, exceptions are surprisingly rare.
Wherever and whenever possible try to stick to them. They will make your life easier and product more successful.

GUIDELINES:


3. Avoid unnecessarily renaming actions that already have established naming conventions.

4. Each screen of your product should be designed to funnel users to perform *one* key action.

4. Anything thatâ€™s buried will seemingly not exist to the majority of users (aka buried in settings)

6. Avoid putting functionality behind non-obvious gestures. 

6. The maximum number of options you should present a user in a flow is two.

16. Use gradients sparingly. Less is more.

16. Only ask for what's absolutely necessary during onboarding.

17. People don't read your educational on-boarding slides. 

17. Contrast is key: colors, weights, sizes. 

18. There shouldn't be large amounts of static text in your product. 

20. The more visually obvious the result of an action is, the more users will be reminded to perform it. Visual real estate is the most expensive real estate. 

21. Always be minimizing the necessary clicks to get to important functionality

1. Buttons that are not standard will most likly have low engagement, making them difficult to build behavior around.

2. Avoid jarring animations and interfaces that move unexpectedly, espcially if outside of the user's control. 

22. Interfaces should follow the principle of least astonishment. They should be highly predictable. 

23. All buttons should look like buttons, and they use everything they can, visually, to allow users to predict what they do and that they are a button.

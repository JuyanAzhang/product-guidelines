*First, three timeless aphorisms that are the pillars behind everything on this list:*

Only simple products last. 

Convenience always wins.

Don't make me think.


Of course, these are guidelines. They aren't the answer 100% of the time. But, exceptions are surprisingly rare.
Wherever and whenever possible try to stick to them. They will make your life easier and product more successful.

*GUIDELINES:*


3. Avoid unnecessarily renaming actions that already have established naming conventions.

4. Each screen of your product should be designed to funnel users to perform *one* key action.

4. Anything thatâ€™s buried will seemingly not exist to the majority of users (aka buried in settings)

6. Avoid putting (important) functionality behind non-obvious gestures. 

6. The maximum number of options you should present a user is two.

16. Use gradients sparingly. Less is more.

16. Only ask for what's absolutely necessary during onboarding.

17. People don't read your educational on-boarding slides. 

17. Contrast is key: colors, weights, sizes. 

18. There shouldn't be large amounts of static text in your product. 

20. If an action isn't being visually advertised to a user, don't expect them to perform it often, if ever.

21. Always be minimizing the necessary clicks to get to important functionality

1. Buttons that are not standard will most likly have low engagement, making them difficult to build behavior around.

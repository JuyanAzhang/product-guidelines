The three tenants behind this list:

- Only simple products last. 

- Convenience always wins.

- Don't make me think.


Remember, these are just guidelines. They aren't the answer 100% of the time, but exceptions are surprisingly rare.
Try to stick to them, they'll make your life easier and product more successful.


GUIDELINES:


1. More than anything, users want control. 

2. Avoid unnecessarily renaming actions that already have established naming conventions.

3. Try not to bury important things, especially if you have to put them in the settings.

4. The maximum number of options you should present a user in a flow is two.

5. Use gradients sparingly. Less is more.

6. People don't read your educational on-boarding slides. 

7. Contrast is key: colors, weights, sizes. 

8. There shouldn't ever be large amounts of static text in your product. Minimize words relentlessly. 

9. The more visually obvious the result of an action is, the more users will be reminded to perform it. Get things into plain sight.

10. Always be minimizing the necessary clicks to get to important functionality. Take out clicks relentlessy. 

11. Buttons that are not standard will most likly have low engagement, making them difficult to build behavior around.

12. Avoid jarring animations and interfaces that move unexpectedly, espcially if outside of the user's control. 

13. Interfaces should follow the principle of least astonishment. They should be highly predictable. Users should never be surprised. 

14. Buttons should look like buttons. 

15. Consistency is the cornerstone to intuitiveness. If your product changes based on conditions or isn't consistent, it won't make sense.

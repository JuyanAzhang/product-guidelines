First, the three pillars behind everything on this list:

Only simple products last. 

Convenience always wins.

Don't make me think.


Of course, these are just guidelines. They aren't the answer 100% of the time, but exceptions are surprisingly rare.
Wherever and whenever possible, try to stick to them. They will make your life easier and product more successful.


GUIDELINES:


1. Avoid unnecessarily renaming actions that already have established naming conventions.

2. Each screen of your product should be designed to funnel users to perform *one* key action.

3. Anything thatâ€™s buried will seemingly not exist to the majority of users (aka buried in settings)

4. The maximum number of options you should present a user in a flow is two.

5. Use gradients sparingly. Less is more.

6. People don't read your educational on-boarding slides. 

7. Contrast is key: colors, weights, sizes. 

8. There shouldn't ever be large amounts of static text in your product. Minimize words relentlessly. 

9. The more visually obvious the result of an action is, the more users will be reminded to perform it. Visual real estate is the most expensive real estate. 

10. Always be minimizing the necessary clicks to get to important functionality. Take out clicks relentlessy. 

11. Buttons that are not standard will most likly have low engagement, making them difficult to build behavior around.

12. Avoid jarring animations and interfaces that move unexpectedly, espcially if outside of the user's control. 

13. Interfaces should follow the principle of least astonishment. They should be highly predictable. 

14. Buttons should look like buttons. 

15. Consistency is the cornerstone to intuitiveness. If your product changes based on conditions or isn't consistent, it won't make sense.

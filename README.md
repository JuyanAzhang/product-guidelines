# product-guidelines
A collection of product guidelines learned the hard way that were designed to stand the test of time. 

This list is designed to be extremely practical: easy to follow and implement. Product designers, managers, etc should be able to follow these guidelines, and, at the very least, avoid creating something where the product's UI/UX is limiting it's potential (which is most products). 

Initially assembled by Juyan Azhang, Jack Beoris, David Polanco, and Josh Rudolf -- accumulated from lessons learned at Krue, Slack, and Chalk.

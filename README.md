# product-guidelines
A collection of product guidelines:

1. Learned the hard way.
2. Designed to stand the test of time. 
3. Structured to be easy to follow and implement.

There are two lists. The first list is more specifically product related, the second list contains more general guidelines for product people to follow.


Initially assembled by Juyan Azhang, Jack Beoris, Adam Kirkland, David Polanco, and Josh Rudolf -- accumulated from lessons learned at Krue, Slack, Whatsapp, Snapchat, and Chalk.

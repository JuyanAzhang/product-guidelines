# product-guidelines

1. Learned through direct experience.
2. Chosen to stand the test of time. 
3. Easy to understand, hard to stick to.

There are two lists. 

The first is a list of guidelines for products. 
The second is a list of principles for product people. 


Initially assembled by Juyan Azhang, Jack Beoris, Adam Kirkland, David Polanco, and Josh Rudolf -- accumulated from lessons learned at Krue, Slack, Whatsapp, Snapchat, and Chalk.

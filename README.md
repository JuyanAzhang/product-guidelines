# product-guidelines
A collection of product guidelines:

1. Learned the hard way.
2. Designed to stand the test of time. 
3. Structured to be easy to follow and implement.

There are two lists. The first list is more specifically product related, the second list contains more general guidelines for product people to follow.

One should be able to follow these guidelines, and, at the very least, avoid creating something where product decisions are limiting its potential, which is most product. 


Initially assembled by Juyan Azhang, Jack Beoris, David Polanco, and Josh Rudolf -- accumulated from lessons learned at Krue, Slack, and Chalk.
